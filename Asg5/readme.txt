This contains 2 C code, 2 executable files, 2 sample input files, 3 output files and a makefile.
1. C codes:
a. macro.c - This is the C code which is the macro preprocessor.
b. assm.c - this is the C code which generates the intermediate code and object code for the assembly code.

2. Executable files:
a. macro - Executable for macro.c
b. assm - Executable for assm.c

3. Sample input files can be used for testing. You may use other input files also through the terminal. 

4. Output files: (made with respect to "input1.txt")
a. macro_output.txt - This is the file generated by macro from the given input file.
b. intermediate.txt - The intermediate file produced by pass 1 of assm.
c. object.txt - The Final object code generated by pass 2 of assm.

5. makefile - This is used to generate the Executable files and run them on a given input file.
Example for makefile - It will be run on the terminal as follows:
make ARGS="input1.txt" run

You can write the name of your input file in place of input1.txt.

Example:
make ARGS="<NAME_OF_INPUT_FILE>" run
